# unity-common
A collection of generic community made tools for Unity. (So you can stop re-writing that one feature over and over again.)

### Contribution Guidelines.
All contributors must adhere to these guidelines to successfully pass a code review.

#1 - Please make a branch using the format: "dev-github_username". e.g. 'dev-jwrmg'. Once your feature is complete you may merge into the core 'dev' branch. Later merges into master will be handled by specific mergers to ensure everything goes smoothly.

#2 - Your code must follow the latest C# coding standards found [here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)

#3 - The folder structure must describe the tool/feature you are working on. e.g. There will be no "Assets/Scripts" folder. The folder will be named "Assets/FeatureNameHere", and everything related to that feature will be put there.

#4 - All namespaces must be prefixed with UC and mimic the folder structure. e.g. for math related things, it will go under the folder "Assets/Math" and implement the namespace UC.Math, example of sub-nameaspaces; Scripts under "Assets/Math/Geomertry" will implement the namespace "UC.Math.Geometry".

#5 - Mark all features you add as an Issue & then reference that Issue in your commit logs to track progress. "[#18] - This references issue number 18.".

#6 - Keep your commit logs clean, clear and concise. Keep in mind that other people may be reading your commit logs.
